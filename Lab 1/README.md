# Staging Interaction

In the original stage production of Peter Pan, Tinker Bell was represented by a darting light created by a small handheld mirror off-stage, reflecting a little circle of light from a powerful lamp. Tinkerbell communicates her presence through this light to the other characters. See more info [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinker_Bell). 

## Lab Overview
For this assignment, you are going to:

A) [Plan](#part-a-plan) 

B) [Act out the interaction](#part-b-act-out-the-interaction) 

C) [Prototype the device](#part-c-prototype-the-device)

D) [Wizard the device](#part-d-wizard-the-device) 

E) [Costume the device](#part-e-costume-the-device)

F) [Record the interaction](#part-f-record)

## Part A. Plan 

My setting is the entrance of Bloomberg Center at Cornell Tech. Players are definitely the students entering Bloomberg Center for classes. Whenever people walk to the entrance of the building, the device can detect whether the person is wearing a mask or not. The goal for the players is entering the building and the primary goal for the device is to ensure that everyone entering the campus building is wearing a mask!

The idea is great! The pandemic is still here and everyone on-campus should wear a mask in any of Cornell Tech's buildings. This can make everyone remember to wear a mask whenever getting to campus!


## Part B. Act out the Interaction

I was planning to have a large screen at the entrance so that not only the entering person can see the screen. After acting out, we do believe that the phone screen is too small and maybe the screen of the device can be even larger for people to notice it.

For now, the device can just show color of red or green to notify people, but if the device can also interact with the building door, then we can prevent students entering the building before masking up! For example, the door will not open until a mask is properly worn.

## Part C. Prototype the device

Tinkerbelle worked smoothly on my laptop and my cellphone! Some of my friends did face some issues while installing and running the package. I am not sure whether the problem is occurred due to their environment setting or their python version, but if this problem can be solved, Tinkerbelle should be an interesting application to play with and to demonstrate some of our ideas of a light change.


## Part D. Wizard the device

The inital recording failed because my phone received some messages and the vibration made it fell on the ground. Therefore, we considered that providing a steady foundation for the device to stand is pretty important!

## Part E. Costume the device

The screen of the device should be large enough for people noticing it. It doesn't really need any specific setting for it, but maybe a foundation at the bottom making the screen standing might help!

## Part F. Record

Shenxin Jiang: Discussed the entire lab with me, gave me feedbacks, and even act out the prototyped interaction for me while I was controlling the device! Thanks to Shenxin!



# Staging Interaction, Part 2 

This describes the second week's work for this lab activity.


## Prep (to be done before Lab on Wednesday)

You will be assigned three partners from another group. Go to their github pages, view their videos, and provide them with reactions, suggestions & feedback: explain to them what you saw happening in their video. Guess the scene and the goals of the character. Ask them about anything that wasn’t clear. 

\*\***Summarize feedback from your partners here.**\*\*

## Make it your own

Do last week’s assignment again, but this time: 
1) It doesn’t have to (just) use light, 
2) You can use any modality (e.g., vibration, sound) to prototype the behaviors! Again, be creative!
3) We will be grading with an emphasis on creativity. 

\*\***Document everything here. (Particularly, we would like to see the storyboard and video, although photos of the prototype are also great.)**\*\*

## Part A. Plan
All the settings, players, activities, and goals remain the same, but I do have more ideas to add to this device. Instead of showing "red" and "green" in different situations, I would also like to add "yellow" which represents that the person may be wearing a mask but not properly covering their mouth and nose. Also, I would also like to add some sound effects under different circumstances. 

* Green 
* Yellow
* Red
