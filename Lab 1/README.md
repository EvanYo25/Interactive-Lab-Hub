# Staging Interaction

In the original stage production of Peter Pan, Tinker Bell was represented by a darting light created by a small handheld mirror off-stage, reflecting a little circle of light from a powerful lamp. Tinkerbell communicates her presence through this light to the other characters. See more info [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinker_Bell). 

## Lab Overview
For this assignment, you are going to:

A) [Plan](#part-a-plan) 

B) [Act out the interaction](#part-b-act-out-the-interaction) 

C) [Prototype the device](#part-c-prototype-the-device)

D) [Wizard the device](#part-d-wizard-the-device) 

E) [Costume the device](#part-e-costume-the-device)

F) [Record the interaction](#part-f-record)

## Part A. Plan 

\*\***Describe your setting, players, activity and goals here.**\*\*
My setting is the entrance of Bloomberg Center at Cornell Tech. Players are definitely the students entering Bloomberg Center for caalsses. Whenever people walk to the entrance of the building, the device can detect whether the person is wearing a mask or not. The primary goal is to ensure that everyone entering the campus building is wearing a mask!

\*\***Include a picture of your storyboard here**\*\*

\*\***Summarize feedback you got here.**\*\*
The idea is great! This can make everyone remember to wear a mask whenever getting to campus!


## Part B. Act out the Interaction

Try physically acting out the interaction you planned. For now, you can just pretend the device is doing the things you’ve scripted for it. 

\*\***Are there things that seemed better on paper than acted out?**\*\*
Maybe the screen of the device can be even larger for people to notice it.

\*\***Are there new ideas that occur to you or your collaborators that come up from the acting?**\*\*
If the device can also interact with the building door, then we can prevent students entering the building before masking up! For example, the door will not enter until a mask is properly worn.

## Part C. Prototype the device

You will be using your smartphone as a stand-in for the device you are prototyping. You will use the browser of your smart phone to act as a “light” and use a remote control interface to remotely change the light on that device. 

Code for the "Tinkerbelle" tool, and instructions for setting up the server and your phone are [here](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/tinkerbelle).

We invented this tool for this lab! 

If you run into technical issues with this tool, you can also use a light switch, dimmer, etc. that you can can manually or remotely control.

\*\***Give us feedback on Tinkerbelle.**\*\*
Tinkerbelle worked smoothly on my laptop and my cellphone! Some of my friends did face some issues while installing and running the package. I am not sure whether the problem is occurred due to their environment setting or their python version, but if this problem can be solved, Tinkerbelle should be an interesting application to play with and to demonstrate some of our ideas of a light change.


## Part D. Wizard the device
Take a little time to set up the wizarding set-up that allows for someone to remotely control the device while someone acts with it. Hint: You can use Zoom to record videos, and you can pin someone’s video feed if that is the scene which you want to record. 

\*\***Include your first attempts at recording the set-up video here.**\*\*

Now, hange the goal within the same setting, and update the interaction with the paper prototype. 

\*\***Show the follow-up work here.**\*\*


## Part E. Costume the device

Only now should you start worrying about what the device should look like. Develop a costume so that you can use your phone as this device.

Think about the setting of the device: is the environment a place where the device could overheat? Is water a danger? Does it need to have bright colors in an emergency setting?

\*\***Include sketches of what your device might look like here.**\*\*
![Part E](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20696474/132272820-4ba72529-4a3b-421a-9f48-93650858239e.jpg)


\*\***What concerns or opportunitities are influencing the way you've designed the device to look?**\*\*


## Part F. Record

\*\***Take a video of your prototyped interaction.**\*\*


\*\***Please indicate anyone you collaborated with on this Lab.**\*\*
Shenxin Jiang: Discussed the entire lab with me, gave me feedbacks, and even act out the prototyped interaction for me while I was controlling the device! Thanks to Shenxin!



# Staging Interaction, Part 2 

This describes the second week's work for this lab activity.


## Prep (to be done before Lab on Wednesday)

You will be assigned three partners from another group. Go to their github pages, view their videos, and provide them with reactions, suggestions & feedback: explain to them what you saw happening in their video. Guess the scene and the goals of the character. Ask them about anything that wasn’t clear. 

\*\***Summarize feedback from your partners here.**\*\*

## Make it your own

Do last week’s assignment again, but this time: 
1) It doesn’t have to (just) use light, 
2) You can use any modality (e.g., vibration, sound) to prototype the behaviors! Again, be creative!
3) We will be grading with an emphasis on creativity. 

\*\***Document everything here. (Particularly, we would like to see the storyboard and video, although photos of the prototype are also great.)**\*\*
